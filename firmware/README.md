# The MicroPython firmware
To make things easier for you a binary version of the MicroPython firmware
during the course is supplied here. Two simple shell scripts allowing to
erase the ESP32 flash and programming it with the supplied firmware are
also supplied. You must however have esptool installed on your system and it must be accessible in the execution path. You can
find it on github: https://github.com/espressif/esptool
